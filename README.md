# URL Shortener Code Test
## Time: 
~1 Hour for dev time, questions and conversation

## Language: 
Your choice. Pick the language and/or frameworks you are most comfortable with.

## Project Summary: 
Today, we will build a simple URL shortener/redirection service similar to [Bit.ly](https://bitly.com/) or [TinyURL](https://tinyurl.com/). The service should allow a user to input a "long" URL, output a "shortened" URL and redirect users to the long URL when the shortened URL is visited. Bonus points for handling edge cases and writing tests as you go. 

Expect to verbally communicate your thought processes and test code when appropriate and possible. You are free to use available libraries or frameworks for building your project, pull code from your previous projects, Google anything you need to or refer to StackOverflow or any other references you might need.

Further, you can solve this anyway you want, as long as you write code to do it, whether that means a command line interface, an api/web interface, etc - it's up to you.

The goal of this project is to understand your thought processes and collaborative, communication and working style. Be sure to think through any potential edge cases or test scenarios that might be important.

You are not expected to finish all of the requirements of the project — when we’re reaching the end of the time, we’ll recap and discuss our progress so far and you may be asked several questions about decisions you made in the test. 


## Example Services 

* [Bit.ly](https://bitly.com/)
* [TinyURL](https://tinyurl.com/)
* [Short URL](https://www.shorturl.at/)

## Specs:

- As a user, I should be able to create a "shortened" URL from a long URL.
- As a user, I should be redirected to the "long" URL when I visit the "shortened" URL in a web browser.
- As a user, I should be able to choose a custom or vanity path when creating my "shortened" URL. 
- As a user, I should be able to delete or rename a "shortened" URL I have created.
- As a user, I should be able to see how many people have clicked on my "shortened" URL.
